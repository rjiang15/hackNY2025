## Introducing the Fun Monitor

T.W: Mild flashing lights and also a purely stupid idea.

Do you want to get fired? What about destroying your computer? Are you secretly a robot?

Now introducing: the __Fun Monitor__. Supported only for MacOS (since it would be useful if it was on Windows), the FM comes pre-packaged in a ready-to-launch app that can reduce your business' value in 3 easy steps. First, install the app. Second, launch the app. Third, run the app.

Much like in real life, monitoring the amount of fun you have can only decrease it! Here are the built in functionalities:
* Change the computer screen's brightness to some random level every 4 seconds
* Become unable to change your volume output to a level besides 0
* Bombard your screen with annoying sticky notes every 10 seconds
* Constantly change the dock size on your computer every second, simulated screen shaking

You might think; surely I can just close the Fun Monitor? Wrong! Once you've started the process, the fun never stops. You'd have to answer 5 CAPTCHAs correctly in a row with all of these gremlin processes running in the background. And, even if you get one right, there's a 40% chance you'll have to start all over anyway for each CAPTCHA. Did I also mention the close window button is disabled?

Parameters are all easily changable at the top of the GUI file. Happy tormenting!

_Important Note: We've included a developer's backdoor with CMD + RETURN that, as of now, will remain in the code_
